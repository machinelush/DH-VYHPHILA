Taxonomy Landing allows overriding the landing page of a taxonomy archive with a custom template.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a new post type, Landing Page.  Requests to a taxonomy archive, such as a category or tag page, will check if a Landing Page has that taxonomy set.  If one exists, and the request is for the landing page (that is, not an explicit request for page 1 or any following page), the Landing Page is displayed rather than the normal page 1 of the taxonomy archive.

Landing Pages are treated like pages rather than posts, in that they support the Page Template theme functionality.
